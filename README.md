# Python Data Analysis (Pandas) - Programming Assignment 3
This repository contains the solution for Programming Assignment #3 focused on Python Data Analysis using Pandas.

## Description
This repository includes two Python-based data analysis tasks:

----


## Problem 1: Basic Data Loading and Displaying


a. Load the `.csv` file into a pandas DataFrame named `cars`.  
b. Display the first five and last five rows of the `cars` DataFrame.

**Expected output:** <br />
  First 5 rows: <br />![Screen Shot 2024-09-16 at 10 05 11 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6ecd77e-3815-4a98-b7c9-2fb9275aa77e)<br />
  Last 5 rows: <br />![Screen Shot 2024-09-16 at 10 07 55 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a65178a7-048c-48ec-8a84-2bf25a5f6a5f)

## Problem 2: Subsetting, Slicing, and Indexing Operations

1. **Subsetting**:<br />
a. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7...) of `cars`.<br />
**Output:**<br />

2. **Indexing**:<br />
b. Display the row that contains the 'Model' of 'Mazda RX4'.<br />
**Output:**<br />

3. **Data Selection**:<br />
c. Find the number of cylinders (`cyl`) for the car model 'Camaro Z28'.<br />
**Output:**<br />

4. **Advance Data Slicing**<br />
d. Determine the number of cylinders (`cyl`) and gear type (`gear`) for the models 'Mazda RX4 Wag', 'Ford Pantera L', and 'Honda Civic'.<br />
**Output:**<br />

# Summary

In completing this task, I encountered a few key insights and challenges:

- The **pandas** library was crucial for efficiently managing and analyzing structured data. It enabled quick data loading, subsetting, and querying with ease.
  
- I faced some minor challenges during programming, such as occasionally forgetting to include a period (`.`) in the code, which led to errors. Additionally, small careless mistakes sometimes prevented the program from running correctly.

- To ensure smooth execution, I frequently used **Shift + Enter** to test my code in increments and confirm that everything worked as expected.
